Welcome to Tales of Tatooine, a burgeoning social media platform in development!

The goal for Tales of Tatooine (ToT) is to provide an immersive and interactive space for fans of the saga. Here, users can engage with their beloved characters, delve deeper into their stories, form friendships, follow their profile updates, and even witness interactions between these iconic figures.

As of today, my project's progress includes:

Secure server connections, ensuring user data is well-protected.
User profile creation functionality, allowing users to curate their personal space in the ToT universe.
One-on-one communication capabilities with various bots, providing a unique user experience.

There is still a lot of work to be done, and I will update the README file while I make progress. So Stay tuned...!
